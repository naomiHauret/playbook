> A text-based RPG where your NFTs become the stars of unique adventures. Pick a storyline, cast your NFTs in different roles, give them a personality type and alignment, and let card-based sequences drive the story. Finish the story to unlock new cards and new ways to play !


Remember when you were a kid and how you made up stories with toys that had nothing to do with each others ? Your favourite teddy bear had one role, barbies another role, action men another role, Pokémon figurines another… and somehow you managed to create a story that was able to entertain you (and maybe some of your friends) for a few hours.

_What if you could do the same with your NFTs ? Define who is who, how they think and react, and go on a cool adventure for a few hours ?_

This is what **Playbook** is: a text-based RPG that relies on a cards deck system and ther player's own NFTs to drive the story and recreate the childhood experience of playing with completely unrelated toys.

The player picks a storyline, decide which of their NFTs will play what role (eg: the knight, the villain, the dragon, the love interest...), and gives them a unique personality type and alignment (chaotic neutral, lawful evil, neutral good etc.) that influence how they react and interact with the different situations and events in the story.

The whole game is playable through [XMTP](https://xmtp.org/)-compatible chat apps, like [Converse](https://getconverse.app/) or [Coinbase Wallet](https://www.coinbase.com/wallet). Using specific commands in the app (eg: typing "/start", "/cast"...), the user is able to perform all different in-game actions and help commands. The gameplay revolves around drawing and playing cards from a deck (action and social sequences), with each NFT playing a different role in the storyline.

The game starts with the user selecting a **storyline**, which defines a specific set of characters, situations and events via a **finite deck of cards**. The player then casts which of their NFTs will play what role in that storyline. Some of those characters will be controlled by the player - they are **protagonists**.

Each of those protagonists get their own deck of cards, which is separated in 2 sub decks : one for active situations (like fights), another for social actions (eg: a discussion between the protagonists while traveling to their next destination).

 The game is complete when either :
 
- all of the protagonists decks are empty (game over) ;
- the conditions to trigger a game over are met (eg: protagonist performed action A, which caused XYZ, leading to a bad ending) ;
- the user completes the storyline

If the player manages to complete the storyline without a game over,  they will receive new cards in their decks.
